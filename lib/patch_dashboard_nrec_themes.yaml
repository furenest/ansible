#
# Replaces a hard coded hex color value with a variable,
# so that the openstack-dashboard-nrec-themes RPM package works 
# as expected with the theme setting "Dark Blue" on wallaby
#
# httpd needs to be restarted in order for the patch to take effect.
#
# Specifically, by replacing the hard coded value,
# table views will no longer be striped, but have
# a homogenous background color. The hard coded color
# value sets the color on even numbered rows in tables.
# This value is replaced with the variable that is used for
# the color on odd numbered rows in tables.
# As an effect of this change, the patch will affect both NREC themes.
# The table background color will be for the themes:
#
# - Light (default): white
# - Dark blue: dark blue
#
# The patch should do the equivalent of the the sed command in the README.md of
# https://github.com/norcams/openstack-dashboard-nrec-themes/
#
# Run example:
# sudo ansible-playbook -e 'myhosts=vagrant-dashboard' lib/patch_dashboard_nrec_themes.yaml
